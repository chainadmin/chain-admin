# Agency-Specific App Download Links

## Overview

Your mobile app now supports **deep linking** - this means each agency can share a custom download link that automatically shows their branding when consumers open the app!

---

## How It Works

### **Regular App Link** (Generic)
```
chainsoftwaregroup.com/consumer-login
```
- Shows "Welcome" + "Find your agency" message
- No logo
- Consumer must enter email and DOB
- App searches all agencies

### **Agency-Specific App Link** üéØ
```
chainsoftwaregroup.com/consumer-login?agency=waypoint-solutions
```
- Shows "Welcome to Waypoint Solutions"
- Shows agency logo
- Pre-fills agency context
- Consumer only enters email and DOB
- Goes straight to their account!

---

## Creating Agency-Specific Links

Each agency has a unique **slug** (their URL identifier). To create their custom link:

**Format:**
```
https://chainsoftwaregroup.com/consumer-login?agency=AGENCY_SLUG
```

**Examples:**
```
https://chainsoftwaregroup.com/consumer-login?agency=waypoint-solutions
https://chainsoftwaregroup.com/consumer-login?agency=abc-collections  
https://chainsoftwaregroup.com/consumer-login?agency=first-recovery
```

---

## How to Share These Links

2. Print on letters, invoices, or payment stubs
3. Consumers scan ‚Üí download app ‚Üí see their agency branding!

## Setting Up for Production

Add to your agency website's `.well-known/apple-app-site-association`:

```json
{
  "applinks": {
    "apps": [],
    "details": [{
      "appID": "TEAM_ID.com.chaincomms.chain",
      "paths": [
        "/consumer-login",
        "/consumer-dashboard",
        "/*/consumer-login"
      ]
    }]
  }
}
```

### **2. Android App Links** (Required for Play Store)

Add to `AndroidManifest.xml` (already configured):

```xml
<intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
  <data android:scheme="https" 
        android:host="chainsoftwaregroup.com" />
</intent-filter>
```

## Examples for Each Agency

Generate links for your agencies:

```javascript
// Example: Generate links programmatically
const agencies = [
  { name: "Waypoint Solutions", slug: "waypoint-solutions" },
  { name: "ABC Collections", slug: "abc-collections" },
  { name: "First Recovery", slug: "first-recovery" }
];

agencies.forEach(agency => {
  const deepLink = `https://chainsoftwaregroup.com/consumer-login?agency=${agency.slug}`;
  console.log(`${agency.name}: ${deepLink}`);
});
```

**Output:**
```
Waypoint Solutions: https://chainsoftwaregroup.com/consumer-login?agency=waypoint-solutions
ABC Collections: https://chainsoftwaregroup.com/consumer-login?agency=abc-collections
