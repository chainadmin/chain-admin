2. The Service

The App provides a communication portal where consumers can view account information provided by participating collection agencies and receive messages/notifications. Payment options may be offered by agencies through integrated processors. Chain is a platform provider and does not itself originate or service consumer debts.

5. Payment Features

Payments may be facilitated via third‑party processors (e.g., card/ACH).

Our collection and use of personal information is described in our Privacy Notice. Agencies are independent entities and may have their own privacy obligations as controllers of their consumer data.

8. Disclaimers

THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS.” WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. We do not guarantee the accuracy of account data provided by agencies.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CHAIN AND ITS AFFILIATES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE APP. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM.

10. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration; Class Action Waiver

Any dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, administered by {{ARBITRATION PROVIDER}} under its rules. You waive any right to participate in a class action or class‑wide arbitration. You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of account creation by emailing {{ARBITRATION OPT‑OUT EMAIL}} with your name and the subject “Arbitration Opt‑Out.”

11. Changes

We may update these Terms by posting the revised version with a new “Last updated” date. Your continued use constitutes acceptance. Material changes will be notified within the App or by email/SMS where appropriate.
