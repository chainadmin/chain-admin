# Overview

Chain is a multi-tenant platform evolving from a debt collection solution into a universal multi-industry platform. It supports five business types (Call Centers, Billing/Service Companies, Subscription Providers, Freelancers/Consultants, and Property Management) with module-specific terminology and branding. The platform offers administrative dashboards, streamlined communication, and consumer portals for account management, real-time data, subscription billing, branded email, payment processing, and third-party integrations, all built on a consistent core structure.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## UI/UX Decisions
The frontend uses React with TypeScript, built with shadcn/ui components on Radix UI primitives, and styled with Tailwind CSS for a consistent, component-based design. Customizable landing pages allow agencies to brand their consumer portals.

## Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query, Wouter.
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, RESTful API, layered architecture, Drizzle ORM, middleware for logging, error handling, and authentication.
- **Authentication**: Replit's OIDC integration with Passport.js for platform users, and email/date of birth verification with JWT for mobile consumer authentication, including biometric login support. Multi-tenant user isolation is enforced.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Application-level tenant isolation with slug-based routing and tenant-level data filtering.
- **Subscription Billing**: Supports defined tiers, email/SMS limits, overage pricing, and segment-based SMS usage tracking.
- **Email Sending**: Uses agency-branded sender addresses for improved deliverability and integrates with Postmark for professional templates and tracking.
- **SMAX Integration**: Comprehensive API integration for SMAX collection software with bidirectional sync for payments, attempts, notes, account retrieval, and payment arrangements. Includes card token syncing (via cardnumber field), consumer portal SMAX payments, currency normalization (decimal-point detection), and SMAX payment retry logic. Critical fix implemented to prevent overcharging: SMAX arrangement payments now correctly use the arrangement amount instead of the full account balance.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrates with USAePay for tenant-specific credentials, card tokenization, various arrangement-based payments, recurring payments, and automated scheduled payment processing via a daily cron job. Automated email notifications are sent for all payment types. The consumer payment dialog includes a calendar date picker and robust validation.
- **Unified Communications**: Merges email and SMS functionalities with templates, campaigns, callback requests, and an automation processor. Features real-time SMS campaign progress tracking, multi-number SMS sending, and a comprehensive variable replacement system supporting standard and custom CSV fields. Includes advanced automation types: Scheduled, Sequence, and Event-based.
- **Account Management**: Features enhanced folder organization with default folders and CSV import integration.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Subdomain-based routing for branded agency portals and path-based routing.
- **Global Admin Portal**: Provides platform-wide management, consumer search, service cutoff controls, subscription requests, and SMS configuration for global administrators.
- **Multi-Module Architecture**: Supports various business types with module-specific customization and a terminology system for UI components.
- **Global Search**: Real-time search functionality across consumers and accounts in the admin dashboard with database-level filtering.

## System Design Choices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, utilizing a multi-tenant schema.
- **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for logo and document uploads, leveraging public URLs and CDN caching.
- **Automation Processor**: Backend endpoint for executing scheduled communications with variable replacement.
- **Postmark Integration**: Enables professional email templates, inbound email handling, and webhooks for tracking.
- **Terminology System**: Provides business-specific terminology across the platform based on the tenant's `businessType`.
